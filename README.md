Shareabouts [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts.png)](http://travis-ci.org/openplans/shareabouts)
===========

Shareabouts is an online mapping tool to gather crowdsourced public input in a social and engaging process. Using Shareabouts, people can drop a pin on a map to provide ideas, suggestions, and comments for planning and design issues. And as a mobile-friendly application, Shareabouts makes it easy to add input on the go.

A short guide to setting up Shareabouts
-----------

It's helpful, but not required, to know about the [architecture of Shareabouts](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/ARCHITECTURE.md) before starting.

<a name="heroku-button"></a>The easiest way to set up Shareabouts is to use the Heroku Button.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This will deploy a fully-functional Shareabouts map and datastore to your account on Heroku (an easy-to-manage hosting service). Hosting this way will cost $50-100 monthly. [Here's the process](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/HEROKU_BUTTON.md).

Alternatively, you may want to use a [different hosting service](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md) and set up the components of Shareabouts manually.

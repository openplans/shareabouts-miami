Through the Our Miami initiative, The Miami Foundation fosters community by building attachment to the city, developing public spaces and retaining young talent in Miami. Our Miami uses research from their Soul of the Community Study that clearly shows activating public spaces and attracting young, talented and creative people in Greater Miami will grow the economy faster than other more traditional measures of economic development.

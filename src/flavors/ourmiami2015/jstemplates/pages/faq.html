<h1>2014 Our Miami Public Space Challenge FAQs</h1>

<p><strong>What is the Public Space Challenge?</strong></br>The Miami Foundation’s Our Miami Public Space Challenge is an idea submission contest open to everyone in Miami-Dade County.  The Challenge uncovers the best ideas for creating, improving and activating local public spaces. The Miami Foundation will invest $100,000 to make the ideas reality.  Health Foundation of South Florida will invest an additional $30,000 for ideas promoting healthy exercise activities and access to fresh food.</p>

<p><strong>Why public spaces?</strong></br>Vibrant public spaces build a stronger sense of community by sparking social engagement between Miamians.</p> 

<p><strong>What are public spaces?</strong></br>They are parks, libraries, public buildings, markets, plazas, playgrounds or any place where people can convene and connect.</p> 

<p><strong>How do I know which spaces are public?</strong></br>
Don’t worry too much about this when submitting your idea.  We want to see everyone's best ideas for improving our city.  If your idea is selected as a finalist, we will help with technical assistance to work through any issues.</br>
If you would like to know the status of a vacant lot or other property in your community, you may check with the <a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/pa/property_search.asp" title="Miami-Dade County - Property Appraiser - Property Search">Miami Dade County Property Appraisers Office</a>.  You can search online via their interactive map or call and request the information.</p>

<p><strong>Who can submit an idea?</strong></br>
Anyone can post ideas: individuals, groups, for-profit companies or nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p><strong>Can an idea be submitted by an informal group? (i.e.: we are not a registered club, group or organization)?</strong></br>
Yes. The Miami Foundation encourages you to form a team around your project that can help you brainstorm, plan and implement your idea.  </p>

<p><strong>Can I submit more than one idea?</strong></br>
Yes.  There is no limit to the number of ideas you can submit.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have to submit a budget or cost estimate?</strong></br>
A budget is not necessary at the time of idea submission. If your idea is selected as a finalist, the Foundation will provide assistance to help you prepare a budget.</p>

<p><strong>When will the winners be announced?</strong></br>
The idea submission phase closes on Tuesday, April 8, 2014.  We will select and announce a group of finalists by late April.  Winners will subsequently be selected and announced in June.  </p>

<p><strong>What happens once the idea submission phase is over?</strong></br>
After the idea submission phase is closed, a group of finalists will be selected.  Each finalist will receive assistance in completing a full proposal, including a budget.  All submitted proposals will be reviewed, and the final winners will be selected from that group.</p> 

<p><strong>How many winning ideas will be selected?</strong></br>
There is no preset number of ideas that will be selected.  For reference, there were 15 winning ideas in the 2013 Challenge.</p>

<p><strong>How much money do winning ideas receive?</strong></br>
Winning ideas will receive a share of $130,000.  There is no predetermined funding level per idea.  Awards will be determined after the finalist phase and will depend on project budgets and available funding. </p>

<p><strong>How are ideas selected?</strong></br>
Winning ideas will be selected by a panel of community experts and placemaking professionals.</p>

<p><strong>I have an idea, but I’ve never done anything like this before.  Will anyone help me get the project done?</strong></br>
Yes. If your idea is selected as a winner, you will receive some technical support and assistance from The Miami Foundation and its partners.  However, it is the idea submitter’s responsibility to organize, plan, publicize and implement the project if the idea is chosen as a winner of the Challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Can I submit an idea for a project already in progress that has previously received some amount of funding?</strong></br>
Yes.  The Miami Foundation encourages collaboration.  If you are already working on a public-space-related project, consider submitting a component of that project to the Public Space Challenge.  </p>

<p><strong>Can I start working on my idea before the winners are announced?</strong></br>
Yes and you are encouraged to do so.  You can start building a team and planning your idea at any point.  You can also start receiving crowd-sourced funding support through <a href="http://ioby.org" title="ioby | ioby brings neighborhood projects to life, block by block.">ioby</a>‘s platform immediately.  </p>

<p><strong>What is ioby?</strong></br>
ioby is an online tool for people who have great ideas for their neighborhoods and want to raise funds and recruit volunteers.  Learn more at <a href="http://ioby.org" title="ioby | ioby brings neighborhood projects to life, block by block.">ioby.org</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Is this an arts contest?</strong></br>
While creativity and the arts can be an important component of improving public spaces, this is not strictly an arts contest.  We encourage all ideas, big or small, that will help make great public spaces in Miami-Dade County.</p>

<p>{{#_}}Vibrant public spaces help connect Miamians to our community and each other.  The Miami Foundation’s Public Space Challenge uncovers the best ideas for creating, improving and activating parks, plazas and local gathering places.  Together with Health Foundation of South Florida and Baptist Health South Florida, we invest $305,000 to make the top ideas a reality.{{/_}}</p>
